# ABOUT

This is a very rough prototype for a card game I want to make. Right now all it does is allow the player to draft cards into
a deck.

Game dev is a lot of work.

### SHORT TERM TODO

actually position stuff properly
clean up borders and theme overrides a bit
end of draft screen and logic
check if queue free is sufficient for removing elements, also check and see how it actually works in terms of order etc

### LONG TERM TODO

Read through the entire manual
watch card game tutorial? on YT
look into whether the Godot gui should even be used or not aka can it all be done via gdscript
